                    <p>My superpowers are my creativity and empathy In my HR career, I formed a passion for Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI). Throughout my work experience, people with disabilities and their barriers are not always thought of when it comes toward inclusion. Accessibility can be lacking in all aspects of modern day life including technology. My goal is to create beautifully designed websites with functionality and accessibility in mind. I want to take this class, so I can combine my superpowers with technical skills.</p>
